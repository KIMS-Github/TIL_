Day 7 :
Math & Statistics : 김도형
-  This Class is deal with Basic and Essential part of Math and Statistics for Data Science and Machine Learning
-  So, Don’t miss any part, any content !
-  Keep Lean and Study Math & Programming after this !
-  Math and Programming is learning from hand work! Like a Learning a Driving a Car
- Your skill builds up as much as you put in your efforts.
- We need a Test for check the What we have learned !

Amount of data Proportional with Data Pattern Complexity
Terms of “Overfitting”
KEY TAKEAWAYS
Overfitting is a modeling error that occurs when a function is too closely fit to a limited set of
data points. (Low generality)
Financial professionals must always be aware of the dangers of overfitting a model based on         limited data.

No Pattern, No Data !
Labeling should be done by a person when learning Supervised models for prediction.
Un-Supervised Model is usually for Classify
Semi-Supervised
Reinforcement with environment
We have to keep studying Programming like a Developer
We must find Specific Business Domain !
