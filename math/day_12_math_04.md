# Day 12: Math (Wrap-up & Q&A)
### Today I Learned!

- Euclidean distance : ‖𝑎−𝑏‖2=‖𝑎‖2+‖𝑏‖2−2𝑎𝑇𝑏 (3.1.14)
- 𝑎‖𝑏‖=𝑎𝑇𝑏(3.1.40)cosine similarity=cos𝜃=𝑥𝑇𝑦‖𝑥‖‖𝑦‖(3.1.33)
- 5 rules for inner product of Vector or Matrix
- Full rank : A matrix is said to have full rank if its rank equals the largest possible for a matrix of the same dimensions, which is the lesser of the number of rows and columns. A matrix is said to be rank-deficient if it does not have full rank.
- np.linalg_matrix_rank(M)
